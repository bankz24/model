## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** for developing the weather prediction app for Windows OS, **broken into main tasks and technical considerations**:

---

### **Project Plan: Weather Prediction App for Windows**

---

### **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**
1. **Objective Definition**  
   - Define the app’s core functionality: predict weather based on user input (location/coordinates) using a machine learning model.  

2. **Tool and Technology Selection**  
   - **Programming Language**: Python  
   - **Machine Learning Library**: Scikit-learn (for simplicity) or TensorFlow/PyTorch (for advanced models).  
   - **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (lightweight) or PyQt (advanced).  
   - **Weather Data Source**: OpenWeatherMap API.  
   - **Packaging**: PyInstaller (to create .exe file for Windows).  

3. **Development Environment Setup**  
   - Install Python (Windows-compatible version).  
   - Install required libraries:  
     ```bash
     pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn requests tkinter pyinstaller joblib
     ```  
   - For PyQt:  
     ```bash
     pip install PyQt5
     ```  

---

### **Phase 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing**
1. **Collect Weather Data**  
   - Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch historical weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).  
   - Alternatively, download a dataset (e.g., NOAA).  

2. **Preprocess Data**  
   - Clean data (handle missing values, remove outliers).  
   - Normalize/scale features (e.g., temperature in Celsius, humidity in percentage).  
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  

---

### **Phase 3: Machine Learning Model Development**
1. **Model Selection**  
   - Start with **Linear Regression** or **Random Forest** for simplicity.  
   - For advanced time-series forecasting, use **LSTM** (TensorFlow/PyTorch).  

2. **Train the Model**  
   - Train the model on historical weather data.  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).  

3. **Save the Model**  
   - Save the trained model using `joblib` or `pickle`:  
     ```python
     import joblib
     joblib.dump(model, 'weather_model.pkl')
     ```  

---

### **Phase 4: Desktop App Development**
1. **UI Design**  
   - Use **Tkinter** or **PyQt** to create a simple interface.  
   - Include:  
     - Input field for location/coordinates.  
     - Button to trigger prediction.  
     - Display area for weather results (temperature, humidity, conditions).  

2. **Integrate ML Model**  
   - Load the saved model in the app:  
     ```python
     model = joblib.load('weather_model.pkl')
     ```  
   - Use the model to make predictions based on user input.  

3. **Fetch Real-Time Data**  
   - Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data for the user’s location.  

4. **Display Results**  
   - Show predicted weather details in the app interface.  

---

### **Phase 5: Packaging and Distribution**
1. **Package the App**  
   - Use **PyInstaller** to create a standalone .exe file for Windows:  
     ```bash
     pyinstaller --onefile --windowed weather_app.py
     ```  

2. **Test the Executable**  
   - Test the .exe file on different Windows versions (Windows 10, 11).  

---

### **Phase 6: Testing and Deployment**
1. **Functional Testing**  
   - Test all app features (input, prediction, display).  
   - Ensure the app handles invalid inputs gracefully.  

2. **Performance Testing**  
   - Ensure the app runs smoothly on low-end systems.  

3. **Deployment**  
   - Distribute the .exe file to users or publish it on a platform (e.g., GitHub).  

---

### **Milestones and Timeline**
1. **Week 1-2**: Setup, data collection, and preprocessing.  
2. **Week 3-4**: Model development and training.  
3. **Week 5**: Desktop app development (UI + ML integration).  
4. **Week 6**: Packaging and testing.  
5. **Week 7**: Deployment and documentation.  

---

### **Technical Considerations**
1. **API Integration**  
   - Ensure proper handling of API keys and rate limits.  
2. **Error Handling**  
   - Handle cases like invalid user input or API failures.  
3. **Cross-Windows Compatibility**  
   - Test the app on Windows 10 and 11 to ensure compatibility.  
4. **Resource Optimization**  
   - Optimize the app for performance on low-spec systems.  

---

### **Expected Deliverables**
1. A fully functional weather prediction app for Windows (.exe file).  
2. Documentation: User guide and technical details.  
3. Source code and trained model files.
